				<h2>Fair Play</h2>
				<p></p>
				<p>An expectation is made of all that take part to adhere to fair play at all times. Whilst it is not prohibited to enter the data for any named celebrity that is alive at the date of submission, this should exclude the short notice addition of persons recently presumed dead, but as yet unconfirmed, should not be added with the expectancy to score easy points.</p>
				<p>It is respectfully requested that to uphold these values, any celebrity for whom a recent press announcement brings notice to their likely demise, should not be submitted to lists. Examples could include the addition of celebrities to lists that have been recently involved in an accident, or where there has been declaration of terminal illness</p>
				<p>The above does not prevent the addition of celebrities where research has been conducted to learn of other information that may influence their inclusion to any list.</p>
				<p>The celebrity list administrator reserves the right to remove any such celebrities, where suspicion of modifying lists by an individual deliberately seeks to take advantage of a recent event for their own gain.</p>

				<h2>General Rules</h2>
				<p></p>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Names added to the list are considered to have celebrity status. This includes all public figures from fields such as Film &amp; TV, Sport, Politics, Monarchy, Science, Literature. A biography of the person should be searchable via Wikipedia or similar sites, in order that their existence and status can be tracked.</li>
						<li>Anybody taking part is responsible for maintaining their own list, and updating it. Information entered must be accurate to the best of their knowledge.</li>
						<li>Users can modify their list at any time. Removing and replacing your list is fine and recommended, subject to the expectations for fair play.</li>
						<li>A maximum of 10 celebrities per user can be stored at any time, with points allocated to user where they have a celebrity entered to their own list.</li>
						<li>You cannot enter a celebrity on or after the date of death, and all such entries will be removed as invalid.</li>
						<li>In the event of a dispute, the administrator's decision is final.</li>
					</ul>

				<h2>Point allocation</h2>
				<p></p>
				<p>Points are calculated in the following way</p>
				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An initial value of the celebrities age at death will be taken<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A value is assigned to the date of entry: Jan 1st is day 1, Feb 1st is day 32, etc<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A percentage is calculated as 365, minus the date of entry and divided by 3<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the percentage is > 100, then it is rounded down to 100%<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Points is initial value, multiplied by the percentage<br /> 
				</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>Example 1: a 65 year old celebrity, entered on 1st January scores:-</p>
				<p>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100 - 65 = 35pts<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;365 - 1 = 364<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;364 / 3 = 121.3 (rounded down to 100%)<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Points = 35 x 100% = <font color=red><b>35 pts</b></font><br />
				</p>
				<p>Example 2: a 55 year old celebrity, entered on 1st July scores:-</p>
				<p>	
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100 - 55 = 45pts<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;365 - 182 = 183<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;180 / 3 = 60%<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Points = 45 x 60% = <font color=red><b>33 pts</b></font><br />
				</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>As demonstrated above, older celebrities can score more points if entered early, when compared with younger celebrities that are entered at a later date.</p>
